Amazon cell labels sentiment prediction based on the product reviews from customer I have used fasttext from Facebook pretrain model to convert word into vector. 
After that I used LSTM followed by FFN to predict Sentiment in 1/0 . 
1 --> good review and 0 --> bad
There are many other option you can used like GLOVE embedding from sandford university.
